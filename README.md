# Week 2

### Prerequisites

Make sure you arrive with:
* A good understanding of ROS basics (see Week 1 above)
* A laptop running Ubuntu and ROS Kinetic
* Access to the Internet (you'll need to download ~1 GB)
* Access to this Github (consider [adding a SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/))
* Access to our Slack channel ([click here](https://ros-workshop-perth.slack.com), request access)

### Catkin workspace setup

* For this week, we'll build a single Catkin workspace called ```workshop_ws``` from scratch. Each day will build on the previous, so make sure you end each day with a working solution!

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workshop_ws/src  # Creates a workspace directory names workshop_ws.
cd ~/workshop_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace  # Initialises the workspace
```

</details>

### Git clone each daily topic

* For each daily topic, clone the repository linked below into the
`src/` directory of the workspace `workshop_ws`. 

<details><summary>Try figure this out yourself first, otherwise, click here to for a hint!</summary>

E.g. for the [sensor-integration](https://github.com/ros-workshop/sensor-integration.git) repository, you'd type:

```sh
cd ~/workshop_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-workshop/sensor-integration.git
```
Or if you are using SSH keys:
```
cd ~/workshop_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:ros-workshop/sensor-integration.git
```

+ Fixing a Broken URDF
+ Adding Sensor to a Robot
+ Controlling a simulated robot

<details><summary>Additional Learning</summary>

+ Detecting an obstacle and stopping the robot

</details>

## Tuesday: [SLAM & Navigation](https://github.com/ros-workshop/slam-navigation)
**What you will learn about:**
+ Creating a Map Using a Lidar
+ Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)
+ Using move_base for navigation

<details><summary>Additional Learning</summary>

+ Find a Object by Navigating Around a Map

</details>

## Wednesday: [Computer Vision](https://github.com/ros-workshop/perception.git)
**What you will learn about:**
+ Using an Camera to Detect Apriltags
+ Using a Real Camera with ROS

<details><summary>Additional Learning</summary>

## Friday: [Mobility Plus Manipulation](https://github.com/ros-workshop/mobility-plus-manipulation)
**Task:**

Navigate in a Gazebo World to Find an Collect as Many Objects as You Can

"Mobility plus manipulation" describes a mobile robot that alternates between navigating its environment and manipulating objects (not to be confused with "mobile manipulation" where navigation and manipulation are performed at the same time).

# Quick Check
At the end of the workshop you should be able to answer these questions:
* What's a node and a topic? 
* Have you recorded a bag file, and what does the rosbag --clock parameter do?
* Have you used rqt_graph to check what topics a node is subscribed to?
* Do you know what a URDF is?
* What's the "tf tree" and have you used rqt_tf_tree for introspection? 
* How would you check how many messages a node is sending per second?
* How to create custom messages using ROS message description language?
* How to add external packages' nodes in a launch file?
* How to edit your package's CMakeLists.txt file to add the source of ROS nodes, messages, services, etc. for compilation?Â
